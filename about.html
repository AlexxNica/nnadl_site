By <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org">Michael Nielsen</a> /
April 2014
</div></p><p>Neural networks are one of the most beautiful programming paradigms
ever invented.  In the conventional approach to programming, we tell
the computer what to do, breaking big problems up into many small,
precisely defined tasks that the computer can easily perform.  By
contrast, in a neural network we don't tell the computer how to solve
our problem.  Instead, it learns from observational data, figuring out
its own solution to the problem at hand.</p><p>Automatically learning from data sounds promising.  However, until
2006 we didn't know how to train neural networks to surpass more
traditional approaches, except for a few specialized problems.  What
changed in 2006 was the discovery of breakthrough techniques for
learning in so-called deep neural networks.  These techniques are now
known as deep learning.  They've been developed much further, and
today deep neural networks and deep learning achieve outstanding
performance on many important problems in computer vision, speech
recognition, and natural language processing.  They're being deployed
on a large scale by companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Chinese
search giant Baidu.</p><p>The purpose of this book is to help you master the core concepts of
neural networks, including modern techniques for deep learning.  After
working through the book you will have written code that uses neural
networks and deep learning to solve complex pattern recognition
problems.  And you will have a firm foundation to use neural networks
and deep learning to attack problems of your own devising.</p><p>Three strong convictions underlie my approach, namely: the book should
be principle-oriented; the book should be hands-on; and the book
should not only describe the pragmatic nuts and bolts of neural
networks, but also engages the grand intellectual adventure they're
part of.</p><p><h3><a name="a_principle-oriented_approach"></a><a href="#a_principle-oriented_approach">A principle-oriented approach</a></h3></p><p>It's better to truly master the core principles underlying neural
networks and deep learning, rather than obtaining a hazy understanding
of a long laundry list of ideas.  Once you've mastered the essential
core, you can rapidly understand other new material.  In programming
language terms, think of it as mastering the core syntax, libraries
and data structures of a new language.  You may still only "know" a
tiny fraction of the total language - many languages have enormous
standard libraries - but new libraries and data structures can be
understood quickly and easily.</p><p>This means the book is emphatically not a tutorial in how to use some
particular neural network library.  If you mostly want to learn your
way around a library, don't read this book!  Find the library you wish
to learn, and work through the tutorials and documentation.  But be
warned.  While this has an immediate problem-solving payoff, if you
want to understand what's really going on in neural networks, if you
want insights that will still be relevant years from now, then it's
not enough just to learn some hot library.  You need to understand the
durable, lasting insights underlying how neural networks work.
Technologies come and technologies go, but insight is forever.</p><p><h3><a name="a_hands-on_approach"></a><a href="#a_hands-on_approach">A hands-on approach</a></h3></p><p>We'll learn the core principles behind neural networks and deep
learning by attacking a concrete problem: the problem of teaching a
computer to recognize handwritten digits.  This problem is extremely
difficult to solve using the conventional approach to programming.
And yet, as we'll see, it can be solved pretty well using a simple
neural network, with just a few tens of lines of code, and no special
libraries.  What's more, we'll improve the program through many
iterations, gradually incorporating more and more of the core ideas
about neural networks and deep learning.</p><p>This hands-on approach means that you'll need some programming
experience to read the book.  But you certainly don't need to be a
professional programmer.  I've written the code in Python (version
2.7), which, even if you don't program in Python, should be easy to
understand with just a little effort.  Through the course of the book
we will develop a little neural network library, which you can use to
experiment and to build understanding.  All the code is available for
download
<a href="https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning">here</a>.
Once you've finished the book, or as you read it, you can easily
master one of the neural network libraries intended for use in
production.  I've listed several at the end of the book.</p><p>On a related note, the mathematical requirements to read the book are
modest.  There is some mathematics in most chapters, but it's usually
just elementary algebra and plots of functions, which I expect most
readers will be okay with.  I occasionally use more advanced
mathematics, but have structured the material so you can follow even
if some mathematical details elude you.  The one chapter which uses
heavier mathematics extensively is Chapter 2, which requires a little
multivariable calculus and linear algebra.  If those aren't familiar,
I begin Chapter 2 with a discussion of how to navigate the
mathematics.  If you're finding it really heavy going, you can simply
skip to the summary of results near the end of the chapter.  In any
case, there's no need to worry about this at the outset.</p><p>It's rare for a book to aim to be both principle-oriented and
hands-on.  But I believe you'll learn best if we build out the
fundamental ideas of neural networks.  We'll develop living code, not
just abstract theory, code which you can explore and extend.  This way
you'll master the fundamentals, both in theory and practice, and be
well set to add further to your knowledge.</p><p><h3><a name="a_grand_intellectual_adventure"></a><a href="#a_grand_intellectual_adventure">A grand intellectual adventure</a></h3></p><p>Much of the book is focused on the nuts and bolts of neural networks
and deep learning - mastering basic technique, in the service of
practical problems.  But neural networks are also part of the grand
intellectual adventure that is humanity's exploration of how
intelligence works.  To regard neural networks as no more than a tool
for solving immediate problems, to take solely the utilitarian view,
is a form of intellectual timidity, a turning away from curiosity.  We
will take time to explore some of the big fundamental questions: will
neural networks one day lead to artificial intelligence?  Will we ever
use neural networks to simulate human brains?  How does deep learning
relate to learning in biological systems?  Is intelligence a
consequence of a few fundamental principles, or is it an agglomeration
of a far larger number of ideas?  No one yet knows the answers to
these questions.  But we'll engage the questions the way they should
be engaged, with curiosity and intellectual chutzpah.</p><p></div><div class="footer">
